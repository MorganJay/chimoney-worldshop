## Getting Started 🚀

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes
### Prerequisites 📋

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM ☝️

```
yarn@v1.21.1 or higher
```

## How To Use 🔧

From your command line, first clone chimoney-worldshop:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MorganJay/chimoney-worldshop

# Go into the repository
$ cd chimoney-worldshop
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start development server
$ yarn start
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:3000/` and you will see the website running on a Development Server, and you can have a look around 🙂
